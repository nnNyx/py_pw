# Deprecated Python Password Manager (High School Grad Thesis)

**Disclaimer:** This project is not maintained. It was a learning experience and may contain outdated practices.

## Description

This repository contains a basic Python password manager implemented with MySQL database connectivity. 
It was developed as part of a high school graduation thesis project, with a focus on understanding password management concepts and basic database interactions.

## Features

- User authentication
- Password storage
- Basic CRUD operations

## Note
- This project is most definitely not intended for production use.
- For a more secure and robust password management solution, I've jumped through a couple myself - from **this** (yes, unironically), to KeePass, and now I self-host an instance of [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), which I can wholeheartedly recommend.
